		<p class = "describeperson">Menelaos Mazarakis is currently a sophomore at Princeton Highschool. He is the President and founder of the Princeton Peru Partnership. Among his passions are learning new languages (proficient in 4 languages: Spanish, Greek, English, and French), traveling the world, and studying world cultures. He is also an avid squash player, intense ping-pong'er, and aggressive debater on philosophical issues. After being born and living in New York for a month, Mexico for 5 years, Miami for 1 year, and Boston for another year, he finally settled down in Princeton in 2003. His experiences in Peru inspired him to lead the Princeton Peru Partnership at Princeton Highschool in hopes of aiding the devastated people of Taray. A strong patriot of his native land, Greece, where he spends his summers, Menelaos is a firm believer that: "Without Greek achievement, the world would be much different." -Anonymous </p>
